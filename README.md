# sample_pen_test

This repository contains the final project for my college level Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course. 

This project involved performing a penetration test on 2 provided VM instances and a write up of maximum 20 pages on findings and vulnerabilities for a fictional company. 

My main focus was on precise technical writing and the penetration test itself.
